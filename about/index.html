		<div class = "aboutUsArticle">
			<p> We are a group of like-minded, self-motivated high school students from all around the Redmond, Washington area who are passionate about robotics. 
			We have multiple teams of varying experience levels, and those that are more experienced typically help out the newer teams. 
			Even with our different backgrounds, we all share a love for robotics!</p>

		<h2>What Do We Do? </h2>
	</div>
	<div class = "aboutUsArticle">
		<p> <b>We build robots!</b> Each team designs, builds, and programs their own robot for the current season. In fact, within a single season, EXO teams often rebuild multiple times, sometimes even creating a new 
		robot altogether. Teams also enter into competitions. These include the local league competitions, the regional competitions, the state competition, and finally the VEX Robotics Worlds Championship. TSA and VEX also partner together, so teams interested in the VEX Robotics Competition at TSA also compete there.
		The current game for the 2020 - 2021 season is Change Up. To learn more, check out the competitions section under "VEX Overview".</p>
		<p><b>...But we do more than build robots.</b> Through the interactive, hands-on platform VEX Robotics provides, we also develop teamwork and leadership skills. We learn how to work together with our 
		different skill sets and personalities, and we learn how to lead a team. We also develop resilience and perseverance when things don't always go right in the process. </p>
		<p> <b> And most importantly, we have fun! </b> Here at Exothermic Robotics, we believe that the experience and process is what matters the most. The results may not always turn out as expected, but
		there's always another opportunity!</p>

		<p>Our official meetings are on Tuesdays and Thursdays, although often times, teams will meet multiple times a week from 5:30 - 7:30 PM, especially before competitions. Each team is given 
		their own key to the space so they more or less get to decide their own meeting schedules, creating a flexible environment. Each team also communicates with each other about who is at the EXO house as well as other information, such as upcoming competitions, fees, etc.</p>

		<p>We have our own workspace located just off of Willows Road in Redmond, Washington. Inside, we've set up a raised practice field as well as tables for each team to work on. Teams share the basic supplies and tools needed to create an effective robot, but can also order their own parts when needed. </p>

		</div>
		<div class = "aboutUsArticle">
			<p> Our club is one of a kind due to its focus on passing our knowledge from generation to generation. Our student board members range from build/programming advisors to supply managers allowing our club to be completely student run. We work in a shared work place, known as the Robot House, so everyone can share tips and advice with each other as we work. We are also a community organization, with members from schools all over the Washington Eastside.</p>
