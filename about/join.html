	<h2> How Do I Join? </h2>
	<div class = "wordSection">
		<p> For any High School students interested in joining Exothermic Robots, you should first attend the annual information meeting held at the beginning of the school year. Additionally, you must fill out a sign-up form and pay a fee of 800 dollars.
		</p>
		<p> Before joining, here are some things to consider: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Have enough time: Planning, designing, building, and programming a robot takes a lot of time and work. Competitions are also time-consuming as well. </li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li> Live near Redmond, Washington: Teams typically meet several times a week, so having a long commute to the robot house would be excruciating  </li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you think you fulfill both of these requirements, contact <a href = "mailto: amolgvaidya@outlook.com">amolgvaidya@outlook.com</a>. Don't worry about having any prior experience. We'll set you up with a team, and get you up to speed!  </p>
