				<p class = "show-on-scroll-left"> In 2016, Exothermic team 10A planned on making a website, although they ultimately did not make one. This year, Exothermic team 10C decided to make a website for not only the Online Challenge, but also for the club as a whole. This will be Exothermic Robotics' first club website!</p>
                <p class = "show-on-scroll-left">Exothermic Robotics is one of the longest-standing VEX robotics club in Washington State. The club focuses on providing the infrastructure and resources necessary for teams
                to succeed in VEX Robotics Competitions. Our teams have competed in Worlds multiple times and have performed exceedingly well. This website
                focuses on presenting our prestigious history and support network to prospective members!</p>
