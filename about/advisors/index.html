	<p class = "sigh show-on-scroll-right">We want to recognize all of our advisors and mentors throughout the years; without them Exo would never have been at the place we are now. This year we have three amazing mentors: Vishwa KN, Thorsten Lannynd, and Tony Li. All three of them are Exo alumni who are devoting their time to make our club better even during these unprecedented times. Our club also has a long list of past advisors, whom we would like to give a big shoutout as well. Click on the boxes below to learn more about each of the mentors and advisors. </p>
