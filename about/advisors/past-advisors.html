	<p class = "sigh show-on-scroll-right">When Exothermic Robotics was first started, there were many coaches who volunteered their time to help 
	advance the club. If it were not for their selfless time and effort, the club would not be where it is today. So, while they are no longer actively participating in the club. we would still like to recognize and give them a huge shoutout below! </p>

				<h4>Co-Founder / Technical Coach</h4>
				<h3>Rick Tyler</h3>
				<p>Rick Tyler founded Exothermics Robotics and was a coach for the club. Mr. Tyler is the Director of Robot Mesh, where he creates curricula and software for the VEX Robotics program and schools. Additionally, from 2010 to 2016, Mr. Tyler was the Director of Online Challenges and the Regional Support Manager for the Robotics Education and Competition Foundation. Unfortunately, he left Exothermic Robotics in 2017, and as a result, our club has become student led, with no official coaches at all. </p>
				<p><b>Fun Fact: </b>Mr. Tyler loves birding, and will often go up into the mountains to observe as well as take pictures of them!</p>

				<h4>Co-Founder / Technical Coach</h4>
				<h3>Bruce Reynolds</h3>
				<p>Bruce Reynolds was a co-founder, director, treasurer, and mentor starting from the second year of Exothermic Robotics, and is no longer a coach for Exothermic anymore. He worked with Team Salsa (VRC 417), which was an all-girls rookie team. With his help, the team built a sophisticated, reliable robot, eventually earning a position at Worlds. Outside of his work for Exothermic Robotics and Yellowstone Robotics, Reynolds is an instructor at the University of Washington. He is part of the UW Professional and Continuing Education program and teaches Computer Science courses. Check out his website here: <a target = "_blank" href = "http://www.brucereynolds.com/?q=welcome">http://www.brucereynolds.com</a>.</p>
				<p><b>Fun Fact: </b> He shares the same name with an English criminal mastermind who pulled off the 1963 Great Train Robbery. When Reynolds (not the criminal Reynolds) was a kid, his parents showed him the article about the train robbery with his name printed on it. They even had it custom printed as a gag gift!</p>
