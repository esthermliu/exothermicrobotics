	<p> At Exothermic Robotics, we have 8 highly capable teams. Each team has about 5 to 7 people, who are all equally ambitious about robotics. All the teams have robots unique to their team. Exothermic teams are all student run, without any parent help, which goes a long way to show how much time and energy we all spend designing, building, and programming our robots.</p>
