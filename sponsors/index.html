Robot Mesh also sends us Robot Mesh stickers for the competition and our club, which many of our teams use to decorate their robots. We are very thankful for what Robot Mesh's support so in return for what Robot Mesh does for us, we include the Robot Mesh logo on the event's sponsors list. We also award their trophies at the Winter Challenge. Additionally, we also hand out Robot Mesh stickers to all of the teams, and send a list of the participating teams after the event.</p>
