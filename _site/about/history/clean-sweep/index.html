			<p>We competed in the Bellevue FIRST VEX Challenge Competition. The game was "Hangin' Around", and it was the first year that FIRST allowed anyone to sign up for the game because 2006
			was a limited-release pilot program. We also chartered Explorer Post 2036 this year as well.</p>
			<p>We built our main robot, "Otis", which had a tank tread lifter that sucked softballs off the field and placed them on a tray on top of the robot. The tray then 
			elevated to place the balls into the highest goal. Otis was heavy and powerful, but we hadn't learned how to effectively build large robots that could maneuver easily, so it 
			struggled to move on the foam mat. Despite clicking clutches and various other frustrations, Otis managed to make its way to the semifinals. </p>
			<p>In addition to Otis, we also built another robot called "The Goat" just for fun. We took it along to the tournament to show it off, and since the tournament was small that year, with only about a dozen teams (some teams didn't come at all), the event organizers allowed the Goat to compete using team #3367. The Goat only had limited ability to handle softballs, but it specialized in 
			tough defense, could score a decent amount of points into the low goal, and could hang from the bar. Ironically, the "fooling-around" robot ended up being more successful than Otis, and made 
			it into the finals before losing to an alliance of robots from the Sky Valley Education Center in Monroe, Washington.</p>
			<p>The team members were <b>Chris H, Kris N, Tristan S, David T, and John T</b>. Chris, Kris, and John were all seniors so this was their last year on the team. Tristan lived in West Seattle, so he quit after the first year because he could no longer get a ride.</p>
			<p>This was the first year we held the spring "Robothon" scrimmage, which we hosted along with the Sky Valley Education Center in Monroe. About 10 teams participated, and it was a blast! This would 
			also be the only year our entire club would fit into one Honda Odyssey, including all the tools and robots.</p>
			<p>The <b>mentors</b> for this first year were Bruce Haley, Rob Krasser, and Rick Tyler.</p>
			<p>Our <b>primary sponsor</b> for this year was LexisNexis, which allowed us to use their facilities and provided sponsorship money. </p>
			<p>Overall, the team only won <b>one award</b> that year: A Regional Finalist award won by The Goat.</p>

				<h4><b>GAME:</b> Bridge Battle (VRC) and Quad Quandary (FVC)</h4>
				<h4><b>CLUB NICKNAME:</b> Exothermic Robotics Club</h4>
				<h4><b>CLUB SLOGAN:</b> It was on fire when we got here.</h4>
				<h4><b>TEAM NUMBER:</b> We originally started with FIRST VEX Challenge (FVC) Teams 417 and 418, although we added Team 575 once more students joined.</h4>

			<p>We competed in the Bellevue FIRST VEX Challenge Competition. This was the first year where we bought our own floor tiles. We couldn't afford to buy a competition
			field, but we did build four goals and had a complete floor for the first time.</p>
			<p><b>Team 417:</b> Team 417 built "Captain Hook", which was a powerful, heavy robot designed to grab a movable goal with a claw, and then drag it around the field putting rings on the spike.
			Hook was a fierce competitor and did very well in the competition, ultimately making it into the semifinals with 575. However, their alliance unfortunately lost to an all-Canadian
			alliance. The members of Team 417 were Saul R, Eric H, Cravixtha A, Evangeline J, and Rebecca J. Everyone on the team except for Eric graduated in 2008. All went on to college. This team won the Innovate Award at the Bellevue FVC event, for having a creative solution to playing the game.</p>
			<p><b>Team 418:</b> Team 418 built "Chopstix", which was a fast, maneuverable robot with our team's first 4" omniwheels. Chopstix did very well in the competition, making it into the 
			finals before losing to an all-Canadian alliance. In recognition of their success on the field, their teamwork, and their engineering approach, 418 won the Inspire award for having the best robot at the competition. The members of this team were Cody M, Richard P, Joel C, Rishi G, and Kris K. This team won a Regional Finalist award and the Inspire Award at the Bellevue FVC event. 418 was our first team to be invited to a world championship event, and they traveled to the Atlanta FTC tournament where they finished mid-pack in a field of 50 championship robots.
			</p>
			<p><b>Team 575: </b>This team built “Plan B” a fast, maneuverable robot with small wheels. After abandoning their first design just 12 days before the tournament, this team built “Plan B” in a little more than a week. Despite obviously having great potential, the bugs were not worked out by the end of the year, and 575 partnered with 417 in the elimination rounds, losing in the semifinals. The members of this team were David T, Preetum N, Paul C, Micah Z, Ranjan P, and Alex. This team did not win any awards at the Bellevue tournament.</p>
			<p><b>Mentors: </b>Bruce Haley, Rob Krasser and Rick Tyler</p>
			<p><b>Sponsor: </b>LexisNexis. They allowed us to use their facilities and provided sponsorship money.</p>
			<p> This was the second year we sponsored the “Robothon” scrimmage, where 575 and 417 teamed up to win the 12-robot event. They were happy that they had finally worked the bugs out, but the dreaded and feared Canadian contingent did not attend. This was the first year we recruited members from Redmond High School and started a beautiful friendship with Pete Saxby, physics teacher.</p>
			<p><b>Awards: </b>417: Innovate Award and 418: Inspire Award, Regional Finalist Award</p>

			<p>We competed in 5 regional competitions this year: the Washington and Vancouver FTC Championships, the West Vancouver VRC, the Gladstone Open VRC event, and the Washington VRC event.
			This year, we bought a complete field, including control electronics, and bought/built complete game components sets for both VRC and FTC.</p>
			<p><b>This season, our sponsors included: </b></p>
				<ul> 
					<li>LexisNexis Applied Discovery</li>
					<li>Redmond High School PTSA</li>
					<li>Brick Journal</li>
					<li>Parents of Post 2036</li>
					<li>Microsoft Employees</li>
				</ul>
			<p><b>FTC Team 417, A SECRet: </b>This team built a large capacity, dual-sided feeding, scissors-lift dumper, designed to dump up to three trays of pucks into a hopper and then empty them into the center goal. While rookies to FTC, they were experienced FLL robot-builders and they took to medium-sized robots like ducks to a pond. Their robot was a fierce scoring machine that could run and block, too. The members of this team were team leader Zach L, Eric H, Andrew F, Anders B, Jill S, Mike W, and Sam D.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Awards: </b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Vancouver, BC, FTC Tournament: Tournament Finalist, Innovate Award, Alliance Captain</li>
					<li>Washington State FTC Tournament: Tournament Finalist, Build Award, Alliance Captain</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><b>FTC Team 418: </b> This team built two unusual robots. For the first cancelled Washington tournament they built a walking robot, and for the second try at the Washington event, they built a very fast, very small robot called the Mousebot. Unfortunately, the high speed combined with the small chassis produced a robot that was almost impossible to control and the robot didn’t do well in competition. Both of these robots were done more for the fun of it than to be competitive, and the members of this team also worked on other robots. Key members of this migrant team were team leader Walker L, Zach L, and Eric H.</p>
			<p><b>FTC Team 575, Team Camelids: </b>This team was comprised of Micah, David, Hailey, Preetum, and Paul. Members Elijah and Hailey joined in mid-season to work on the robot.  FTC 575 only competed at the first cancelled Washington event and the “makeover” event in February. Their simple front-loader robot did well enough to team up with 417 and go all the way to the finals. Due to intense time pressures getting their VRC robot done for the Gladstone Open the next week, final development and autonomous software for this robot were not quite done by the time of the event, or they could have done better.</p>
			<ul><li><b>Awards:</b> Washington State FTC Tournament: Tournament Finalist</li></ul>
			<p><b>VRC Team 417, Team Salsa, Robot Cube Dude: </b>Team 417 was an all-girls team, and consisted of Raluca, Maya, Tara, Quinn, and Ruchi. Their mentor was Pete Saxby, and they were all rookies. Working with Mr. Reynolds, they built a sophisticated 2-joint arm that was the first of our Elevation robots to reliably score two goals in auto. Members of this team were Quinn T, Maya B, team captain Raluca I, Tara B and Ruchi. After struggling at both of the Vancouver tournaments, never quite getting the hang of their complex arm, this team won the Programming Skills Champion Award in Redmond, earning a position at Worlds, where they competed with a brand-new robot. They went 1-5 in qualifying at the tournament, having some tough luck.</p>
			<p>Their robot was the fastest on the team, and possibly the fastest of all 261 robots at the tournament. Their robot at Worlds: 12" long, 14" wide, four wheels, six-motor drive, 2.75" solid and omniwheels, dual tank-track belts, twin towers, arm lift 60:12, drive 48:15. Weighed 3.5kg or 7.8 pounds.</p>

			<li><b>Awards: </b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Washington VRC Tournament, Redmond: Programming Skills Challenge Winner</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><b>VRC Team 418, Team Eye, Robot Retina: </b>Exothermic Eye competed with a large, complex robot for their first two tournaments. Having dealt with a variety of challenges getting this robot to work properly, they took it apart seven days before the upcoming Redmond tournament and built a new robot for the tourney, where they excelled. They were the captain of the Tournament Champion Award alliance, and won the Amaze Award and the Robot Skills Championship, for a double-qualification to World Championships. This team consisted of Tyler N, leader Javid H, Ashoat T, Jonathan S, Rishi G, Sean F, Alex V, and Josh O. Their robot from Redmond went on to World Championships largely unchanged, where they had a great tournament. They went 5-1 in qualifying and went on to be an alliance captain. With only one person returning from last year and the rest rookies, this team had a fine season.</p>

				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><b>VRC Team 419, Team Moving Stairs, Robot Otis HYPE: </b> Their robot did well at West Vancouver in December, going into the elimination rounds. This team won a Tournament Finalist Award at the Gladstone Open tournament in February, after going undefeated in qualifying. They went on to win a Tournament Champion Award at Redmond in March, teaming up with 418 to earn our club’s first tournament win. An all-rookie team, they made major changes in their robot for each competition. Their world championships robot only looked a little like the one that was on the first place alliance at Redmond. This team consisted of John D, Josh G, Kevin B, Mercury H, Tommy C, Taylor G, Walker L, and Hailey A. They competed at the World Championships, where they went 2-4, including two tough matches where opposing robots pulled out some of their control cables.</p>
			<p> Their robot, as seen at Worlds, looked like this: Four wheels, two 4" omnis, two 4" regular, short wheelbase, six-motor drive, 11 pounds.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Awards: </b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Gladstone Open VRC, Vancouver, BC: Tournament Finalist</li>
					<li>Gladstone Open VRC, Vancouver, BC: Alliance Captain</li>
					<li>Washington VRC Tournament, Redmond: Tournament Winner Robot </li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><b>VRC Team 420, Team Secret, Robot A Secret: </b>Team 420 was made up of our FTC team 417, who decided to build a VRC robot just three weeks before the Redmond tournament, and worked hard to get their robot done in time. It was fast and effective – and very, very small. It was called “Mousebot.” They built a new robot for the World Championships, using a flat 4-bar-link lifting a dual-tank tread cube gripper to reach all the goals. Spectators thought it looked like a snake striking out the grass. They could do any of the scoring moves the game required, including sucking cubes from the autoloaders. They went 3-3 in qualifying and were selected for an eliminations alliance where they went to the quarterfinals.</p>
			<p><b>VRC Team 575, Team Haiku, Robot Haiku: </b> This was our “senior team” (even though none of them are seniors this year) because they are our most experienced Vex team. They made continuous improvements to their robot after Gladstone, and added at least 20 pounds of software before VRC Worlds. This team consisted of their leader David T, and the rest of the members: Paul C, Ranjan P, Preetum N, Micah Z, Ben W, Arjun N, and Gary M. At Worlds, they had a tough schedule and only went 2-4 in qualifying. They were selected for an eliminations alliance and lost in the quarterfinals.</p>
			<p>Robot (as seen at Worlds): 12" long, 12" wide, four wheels, six-motor drive, 2.75" solid and omniwheels, dual tank-track belts, twin towers, arm lift 84:12, drive 36:12. Weighed 3.725 kg or 8.2 pounds.</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Awards: </b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>Vancouver BC VRC Tournament: Amaze Award</li>
					<li>Gladstone Open VRC, Vancouver, BC: Excellence Award</li>

				</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><b>VRC Team 1899, Saints Robotics, Robot TrashBot: </b> In the middle of the season, Exothermic Robotics visited FRC team 1899 just before they shipped their big robot. Some of the members of 1899 got curious about our Vex robots, and ended up joining Exothermics and starting VRC team 1899. Team members were Dennis L, Franklin S, Eric S, and leader Edward J. They competed successfully at the Redmond event with a simple track-lifting robot, and then built a novel holonomic drive robot for the Vex World Championships. They were very successful at worlds, racking up a record of 5-1-0 and going on to be an alliance captain in the Eliminations. A very impressive result for a team with a total of 10 weeks of Vex experience.</p>
			<p>Their robot (as seen at Worlds): Four 4" omni wheels, holonomic drive on a square chassis, four-motor drive, 3.5 kg or 7.8 pounds</p>
			<p>All six of our robots competed at the Vex Worlds. Two of our three FTC robots competed in regional finals matches.
				Thirty-four students and fourteen adults traveled to Dallas for the Vex Worlds
				Of our forty students, only eight are graduating this year.</p>
			<p>The technical mentors were Rick Tyler, Bruce Reynolds, Chris Culler and Haji Habibi. Non-engineering mentors included Heidi Lovett, Carolyn Davids, Jean, Shannon Nagamine, and Melinda Tyler.</p>
