		</div>
		<p>TSA is a national student organization that aims to help students develop their STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) skills. It also allows students to practice their 
			leadership, academic, and management skills. Since VEX and TSA share a common purpose, they naturally partnered together to bring the TSA/VEX Robotics Challenge to life, which allows students to 
			use their STEM skills practically in a hands-on environment.</p>
		<p>If you're interested in registering for the TSA VEX competition, here are the steps: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>Affiliate with TSA for the 2020-2021 school year</li>
			<li>Register as a VEX VRC team for the VEX Robotics Competition</li>
			<li>Pay the VEX registration fee</li>

			<img src = "{{ site.baseurl }}/images/PLTW.jpg"/>
		</div>
		<p>Project Lead The Way (PLTW) is a nonprofit organization that helps create unforgettable learning experiences for PreK-12 students in more than 11,5000 schools in the United States.
		They encourage learners to solve real-world problems through hands-on activities and projects.</p>
		<p>VEX is the only robotics platform that is offered at PLTW schools. Their courses implement VEX EDR and VEX IQ, meaning that their students are exposed to the entire robotics experience, from 
			designing to building and programming. VEX is a proud supporter of the following PLTW pathways:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>PLTW Launch (PreK - Grade 5) </li>
			<li>PLTW Gateway (Grades 6 - 8)</li>
			<li>PLTW Computer Science (Grades 9-12)</li>
			<li>PLTW Engineering (Grades 9-12)</li>
