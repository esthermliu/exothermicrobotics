			<h3> Their Mission:</h3>
			<p> VEX Robotics creates tools that educators and mentors can use to encourage and develop the learners today into the problem solvers of the future. VRC, or the VEX Robotics Competition,
			is an opportunity to grow your programming and design skills through high school in a competitive environment.</p>
			<h3> Their Vision: </h3>
			<p> VEX hopes that one day, every student will have the opportunity to experience the excitement of hands-on STEM learning and creation. Regardless of age or background, VEX wants all people to 
			feel inspired by technology personally and see the importance of creative problem solving for a better future.</p>

			<h3> A Letter From VEX: </h3>
			<p> Our world faces a serious problem. It’s a problem
				that, without explicit and intentional action, will
				eventually stagnate global progress and lead to
				a workforce that is unmotivated and ill-equipped
				to solve its future problems. As the world grows
				more technologically complex, the challenges
				we face every day will continue to escalate along
				with it. A cell phone has more failure modes than a
				landline. The internals of an electric car are more
				difficult to comprehend than a V8 combustion
				engine. Unmanned drone legislation is more
				nuanced than defining a maximum speed limit.</p>
				<p>
				Dubbed “the STEM problem”, the situation is
				equally simple to understand, yet difficult to
				solve. In many cases, the traditional methods of
				teaching science, technology, engineering, and
				math (STEM) will not be enough to adequately
				prepare students for this complex world. This is
				often coupled with the unfortunate reality that by
				the time they reach an age capable of grasping
				these critical topics, students may have already
				determined that they are “not cool” or “boring”.
				Without the skills or passion necessary to
				approach these problems in an educated manner,
				you cannot possibly expect to be productive in
				making forward progress or even sustaining the
				status quo. </p>
				<p>
				The VEX Robotics Competition exists to solve
				this problem. Through its uniquely engaging
				combination of teamwork, problem solving, and
				scientific discovery, the study of competitive
				robotics encompasses aspects of STEM. You’re
				not building VEX EDR robots because your future
				job will involve tightening shaft collars on a metal
				bar – you’re executing an engineering design
				and problem-solving process that resembles the
				same mindset used by rocket scientists, brain
				surgeons, and inventors around the world. </p>
				<p>
				Robotics Competition Tower Takeover is not just a
				game that we invented because it is fun to play – it
				is a vehicle for teaching (and testing) teamwork,
				perseverance in the face of hardship, and
				provides a methodology to approach and solve
				new challenges with confidence.
				</p>
				<p>
				Contained in this manual are the rules that shape
				VRC Tower Takeover. These rules are designed
				to simulate the constraints that will outline any
				real-world project. They are intended to promote
				creativity without punishing innovation. They are
				balanced to promote fair play while encouraging
				competition.</p>
				<p>
				We encourage you to keep in mind that a VEX
				Robotics Competition game is more than just a
				set of game objects worth varying amounts of
				points. It is an opportunity to hone the life-long
				skills that will characterize the problem-solving
				leaders of tomorrow.
				</p>
				<p>
				Good luck, and we’ll see you on the playing field!</p>
				<p>
				Sincerely,</p>

				& Competition Foundation, Robomatter, DWAB
				Technology, and VEX Robotics.</p>
