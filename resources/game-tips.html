		<p class = "show-on-scroll-right">Here are some general competition tips:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Don't panic.</b> If something goes wrong with your robot, stay calm because chances are, there's someone around you that knows what's wrong with your robot.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Not everything will always go as expected.</b> Prepare yourself for the worst.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Wear your safety glasses!</b> Bring a lot of safety glasses in case you lose some or if others want to borrow a pair or two.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Plan out who your drivers are before the competition starts.</b> The qualification matches are not a time to try out new drivers.</li> 
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Practice driving a lot before the competition!</b> Practice will help reduce stress and allow you to perform better. </li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Keep your area organized at the competition.</b> It'll help you do repairs easier and will make a good first impression on the judges when they come to interview your team.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Assume that every part of your robot will break at the competition.</b> Bring replacements for everything!</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Shake your opponents' hands afterwards and say good game!</b> Do this no matter how good or bad the match was.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Keep track of time. </b> You don't want to miss out on your match because your team wasn't keeping track of the time.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Accept that no matter how friendly your opponents are, they will do whatever they can to win. </b> Everyone wants to win, and as long as what they're doing is legal, there's nothing you can do about it. Don't get too caught up about it.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Label all your stuff. </b> Often times, other teams will ask to borrow materials, so labeling things prevents them from getting mixed up with other teams' stuff.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Take lots of videos and photos during the competition. </b> You can post these on your social media accounts later (and maybe even subtly brag if you win)!</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Develop good communication amongst your drive team. </b> When you practice before the competition, practice having a member from the drive team communicate with the driver about what to do.
			This way, everyone can get familiar with the whole system.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Communicate with your own drive team and your allied drive team about a strategy.</b> Try to stick with this strategy for as long as possible.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Check all systems before every match. </b> Better to be safe than sorry.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Change batteries often. </b> Have a battery charging station and put one person in charge of changing the batteries for the entire competition.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Double check if you are using the correct code. </b> Try it several times in the practice fields before the actual match.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Make sure you turn the robot on before the match. </b> This is super important! It won't hurt to check one more time.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>During the competition, scout for potential allies. </b> Assign one person on the team to take notes on other teams and report back about which teams would be the best alliance partner.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Judges are people too! </b> They are probably rooting for you, so don't be too nervous. Tell them all about your robot. They'll love it.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Practice for your interview. </b> Make sure everyone knows what they're talking about. Also, make sure to talk slowly and coherently to the judges. Sound confident! You got this!</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Talk to other people at the competition! </b> You can teach them a thing or two and vice versa. Plus, more friends, right?</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Sell your team. </b> The competition is no time to be humble. Otherwise, you might have a hard time getting picked by a good team.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Wear your club or team shirt. </b> You're representing your team and club. You want others to know what organization you're part of!</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Always back up your teammates. </b> When things go wrong, don't attempt to blame it on your team members.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Don't be afraid to check out other teams! </b> Ask them questions and learn from them. </li>
