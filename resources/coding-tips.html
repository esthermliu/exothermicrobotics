		<p class = "show-on-scroll-right">Here are some general coding tips submitted by the Exothermic Robotics club:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Make sure the program works with the competition mode/switch.</b> Don't wait until the competition to check!</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right">For autonomous, plan out the <b>EXACT</b> route first, but be willing to <b>improvise as you go.</b> </li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right">Work on the autonomous <b>one step at a time </b> so you know exactly where the problem is.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right">The programmer should <b>participate in the building</b> so they know how the robot works and moves. This is the same vice versa. </li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Add descriptive comments to your code so other people can understand it.</b> The more descriptive the comments, the better. Judges love it when you do this because it makes their job so much easier. </li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Use PID. </b>PID stands for <b>P</b>roportional <b>I</b>ntegral <b>D</b>erivative. There is more information about it below.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Be consistent! </b> A consistent Autonomous program is much better than a higher scoring inconsistent Autonomous program.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Make things easier for your driver </b> by automating some parts.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right">Use brakeType hold/break <b>only when you need it.</b></li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Organize your code!</b> You might think that you know what your code is doing right now, but when you look at it again in a few days, you'll be surprised at 
			how hard it is to decipher your own code. Do your future self a favor by organizing your code. It'll save you so much time.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Multitask whenever possible.</b></li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Make sure your functions don't get stuck.</b></li>
		</ul>
