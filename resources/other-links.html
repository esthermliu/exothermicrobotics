				<p>The VRC Hub App is amazing for teams attending competitions. It helps you keep track of the score without requiring any thinking at all! All you have to do is count up the number of cubes in each goal
				and in the towers, and the app gives you the score. It also has a timer for regular, skills, and VEX U, so you can practice timing yourself as you drive your robot around. </p>
