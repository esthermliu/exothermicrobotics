		<p class = "show-on-scroll-right">Here are some general notebook tips submitted by the Exothermic Robotics club:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Start early!</b> Don’t wait until the last second to start. It’s pretty obvious to the judges who actually spent time on their notebook.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>A good notebook does not mean a perfect notebook.</b> The purpose of an engineering notebook is for you to document what you did wrong so you don’t make the same mistake again.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Look through the rubrics</b> (The rubric is at the bottom of the page) for different awards so you know exactly what the judges are looking for.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Fill out the table of contents as you write the meetings. </b>It takes a lot longer than you think to fill out the table of contents for a whole notebook of meetings. </li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Format your notes in a way so people actually want to read it. </b>Don’t write everything in one big paragraph.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Write an entry each time you have a meeting. </b>You don't want to wait until you've forgotten what you've done in the meeting to write it.
			It'll be much harder to write, not to mention it'll probably be less detailed.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Write neatly! </b>The judges don't want to decipher messy handwriting, and probably won't bother to read it if that's the case. Also, good handwriting makes an excellent first impression.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Consistency is key.</b> Try to format each entry the same, so the judges can easily find information.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Make sure that everyone contributes to the notebook. </b>Have different people write different sections, so the notebook will look like a team effort.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Include lots of hand-drawn pictures!</b> It makes it look like you put a lot of effort into it and also makes the notebook seem more personal.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Try to get a bound quad-ruled notebook. </b> It's neat and makes a great first impression even before the judges open it up.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Write notes about each competition.</b> Write about how the competition went, each person's role, and how your team is going to improve your robot based off of your performance in the competition.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Get creative! </b> Judges get bored of reading the same thing all the time. For instance, what if you wrote from the robot's perspective?</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Check for proper spelling and grammar! </b> Proper conventions makes the notebook seem more professional and gives you that extra edge in the competition.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Label all your pictures and number them. </b> It makes the notebook look neat, organized, and professional. It also makes it easier to refer to the figures in your entry.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Never erase or remove anything from the notebook. </b> If you made a mistake, simply cross it out with a single line. The notebook is supposed to be where you document <i>everything</i>, even 
			all the bad ideas and designs.</li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Use Computer Aided Designing (CAD)</b> to come up with designs. It also helps you improve already existing designs. </li>
			<li class = "show-on-scroll-right"><b>Write in pen or permanent ink</b>, but at the same time, make sure it doesn't bleed through the pages. Also, try to avoid smudging as much as possible. </li>
