I"Ð<p>The Covid restrictions for the past few months have finally lifted and Washington has posted a new system with each county starting at level 1. This means we can now officially have teams meet on their day at the house again. Each team is allowed a maximum of 5 people at the robot house at a time, similar to what we did during the summer. We are still awaiting further updates regarding whether or not we can have in-person competitions, and will let you know when we receive new information. Thank you for your cooperation!</p>
