I"Ê<p>Tomorrow, Exothermic Robotics will be hosting their annual Exothermic Winter Challenge. In order to ensure the event runs smoothly, volunteers met beforehand to split up roles and receive training for their positions.
This afternoon, all Exo teams, parent volunteers, members from other local teams, as well as the Regional Support Manager met at Timberline Middle School to set up for the tournament. The afternoon was spent transporting competition equipment from Cavelero Mid High School, Blaze Education, and the Exothermic Robot House, as well as the collaboration of many people to arrange the competition venue before the tournament.
We canâ€™t wait to see all the amazing robots competing tomorrow!</p>
