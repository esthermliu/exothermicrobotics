I"*<p>Hello students and parents! <b>Saturday, June 22 at 2:30 PM at Redmond Library</b> will be Exothermic Robotics’ information meeting for the 2019-2020 season. We encourage everyone who is interested in STEM and robotics to come and check us out. This year, we will be recruiting during June instead of September because we want to give our new teams a head start over the summer. Please note that spots are on a first-come-first-serve basis due to the limited number of spots. We can’t wait to see the next group of robot-builders on Saturday!</p>
