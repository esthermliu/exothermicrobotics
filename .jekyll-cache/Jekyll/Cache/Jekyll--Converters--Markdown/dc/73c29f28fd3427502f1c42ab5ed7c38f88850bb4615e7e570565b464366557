I"H<p>Hello everyone! This year, we will be hosting the Exothermic Winter Bash Tournament on Saturday, February 22 at Timberline Middle School. The Exothermic Winter Bash is a yearly tradition that was started in 2014. We need volunteers on Friday night to help set up and move equipment from our club and robot mesh to Timberline. If you can help, please inform us ASAP. Exothermic Teams are also expected to show up early on Saturday morning so we can make sure everything runs smoothly. And to all the teams that will be competing: good luck and we canâ€™t wait to see you there!</p>
