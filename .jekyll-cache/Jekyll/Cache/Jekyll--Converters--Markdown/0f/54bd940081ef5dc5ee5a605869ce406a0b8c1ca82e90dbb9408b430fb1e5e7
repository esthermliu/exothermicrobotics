I"C<p>Today marks the first day new teams are getting together to start brainstorming ideas. As of now, we have 4 new teams and 4 experienced teams (for a total of 8). For some of the more experienced teams, we have already started building our ideas for Tower Takeover. For the new teams, some of us have already formed teams and are ready to start building, while others are still looking for the perfect teammates. Please note that there will be a full refund until October so everyone will have time to see if robotics is a good fit for them. This will be an exciting year!</p>
