I"h<p>This has been overall a great year. We came into the season with no expectations as this was our first year, so getting regional finalists certainly was a pleasant surprise. Not to mention, we learned some valuable lessons along the way. Otis was strong and powerful, but it wasn’t able to maneuver easily on the mats. In comparison, The Goat was much better at moving around, and was able to do better despite not being able to handle softballs well. Next year, we’re planning on taking these lessons and applying it to our engineering and design process as we make our new robot. Go “The Combine”!</p>
