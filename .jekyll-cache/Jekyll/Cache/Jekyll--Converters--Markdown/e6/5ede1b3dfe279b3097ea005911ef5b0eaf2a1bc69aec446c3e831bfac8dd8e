I"Ç<p>Tomorrow, we will have our annual robot house clean up. Each member from every team is expected to come and help clean up our workspace. There is a lot of trash around the house and parts are scattered all over the floor. Please note that teams will NOT be allowed to register for any competitions or buy any parts until their area is clean. Vishwa will not sign them up. Please inform your teams about this clean-up. Letâ€™s make EXO clean again!</p>
