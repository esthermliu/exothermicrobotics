I"1<p>This is our first year hosting the spring “Robothon” scrimmage. We hosted the event along with Sky Valley Education Center in Monroe. Around 10 teams participated, and it was a blast! Our team is so small that we all managed to squeeze into one Honda Odyssey with all our tools and our robots.</p>
