I"G<p>Itâ€™s less just over one week until the Washington State Championship and all eight Exothermic teams are preparing by practicing on brand new field tiles. Exo recently switched to using the anti-static tiles so teams can practice on a newer field. Good luck to all the Exo teams at the state championship next weekend!</p>
