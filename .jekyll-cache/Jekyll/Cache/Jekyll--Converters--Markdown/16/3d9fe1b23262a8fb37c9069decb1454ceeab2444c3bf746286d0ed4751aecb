I"V<p>We competed in the Bellevue FIRST VEX Challenge Competition, our first competition ever with our first robot! Although we did not quite achieve the results we expected, it certainly was an amazing learning experience. Our main robot, Otis, was heavy and powerful, although it could not maneuver easily and struggled to move on the mats. This, however, was only one of the various frustrations we encountered during the competition. Despite the harships we encountered, Otis led our team as we bravely soldiered on, eventually making into the semifinals! Unfortunately, Otis lost in the semifinals.</p>

<p>The competition hadn’t quite ended for us though…because we still had The Goat. We decided to take The Goat along with us to the competition just to show it off even though we weren’t planning to actually compete with it because there weren’t enough spots originally. When we got the competition though, we discovered that several teams hadn’t arrived, so the event organizers allowed The Goat to compete using team #3367. Ironically and unexpectedly, The Goat actually did better than Otis, making it into the finals before losing to an alliance of robots from the Sky Valley Education Center based in Monroe, Washington.</p>

<p>Overall, it was a great experience and we’re looking forward to improving our robot for the next competition!</p>
