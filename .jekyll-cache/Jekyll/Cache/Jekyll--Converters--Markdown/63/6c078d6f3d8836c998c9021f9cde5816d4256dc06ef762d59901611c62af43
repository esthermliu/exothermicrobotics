I"¹<p>This is the second year we hosted the Robothon Scrimmage. This time, 12 robots attended the competition, including the three robots from EXO. Team 575 and 417 teamed up to win the finals, and fortunately, the dreaded Canadian teams did not attend. Also, we managed to recruit several members from Redmond High School, and started a close friendship with Pete Saxby, a physics teacher at RHS. He has agreed to help sponsor us! Go EXO!</p>
