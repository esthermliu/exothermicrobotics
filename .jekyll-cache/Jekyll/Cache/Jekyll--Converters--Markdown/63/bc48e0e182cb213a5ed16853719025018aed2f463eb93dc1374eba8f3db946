I"Ï<p>Congratulations to teams 10A and 10F who competed at the Spokane Valley Tech VRC Tournament today! 10A came home with the Robot Skills Champion Award with a score of 22, and 10F won the Excellence Awards. This means that 7/8 of the current Exo teams have now qualified for State on March 7th and Sunnyside High School. The two teams formed an alliance for eliminations, ultimately becoming Semifinalists. Once again congrats to these two teams and go EXO!</p>
