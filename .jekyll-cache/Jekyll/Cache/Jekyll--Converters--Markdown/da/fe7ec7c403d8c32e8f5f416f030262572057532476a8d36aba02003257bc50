I"^<p>Hey everyone! The student board for the 2020-2021 season has been decided. I’d like to make it clear that choosing this was not an easy decision at all, and if you applied for a role but weren’t selected, please don’t be demotivated and continue to keep helping each other as well as any new members as you have been. And for those of you who were selected for board, lets not forget to ask our peers for ideas since I read a ton of good ideas in all of your applications.</p>

<p>The 2020-2021 student board will be as follows:</p>
