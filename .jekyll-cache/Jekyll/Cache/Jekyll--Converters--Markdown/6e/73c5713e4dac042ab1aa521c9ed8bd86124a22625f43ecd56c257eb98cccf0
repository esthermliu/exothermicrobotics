I"™<p>Team 10C, Exothermic Creation participated in two online challenges this season: VEX Robotics Competition Team Website Challenge Sponsored by Dell and the Electronics Online Challenge Sponsored by Texas Instruments. For the Website online challenge, 10C decided to submit the official Exothermic Robotics website (exothermicrobotics.org), which is created and managed by 10C member Esther Liu. There had been many changes, both major and minor, to the website over the past year, and we welcome you to check it out under Media -&gt; Website. For the Electronics Online challenge, members of Exothermic Creation deconstructed a Vex Transmitter and Receiver. After taking a look at the inside, 10C was surprised by the plethora of parts that make up the 2006 version of a controller.</p>
