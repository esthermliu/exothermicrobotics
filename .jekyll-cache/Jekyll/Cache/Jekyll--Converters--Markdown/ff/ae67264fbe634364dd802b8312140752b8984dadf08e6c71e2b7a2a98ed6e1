I"]<p>We competed in the Bellevue FIRST VEX Challenge Competition, our first competition ever with our first robot! Although we did not quite achieve the results we expected, it certainly was an amazing learning experience. Our main robot, Otis, was heavy and powerful, although it could not maneuver easily and struggled to move on the mats. This, however, was only one of the various frustrations we encountered during the competition. Despite the harships we encountered, Otis led our team as we bravely soldiered on, eventually making into the semifinals! Unfortunately, Otis lost in the semifinals.</p>
