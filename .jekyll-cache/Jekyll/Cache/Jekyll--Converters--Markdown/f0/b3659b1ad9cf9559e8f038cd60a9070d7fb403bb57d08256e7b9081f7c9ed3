I"Û<p>The Washington state restrictions were extended for another week today until January 11th. This means that the house will remain closed until that point and we will need to continue working as remotely as possible. It is likely if you had comps during this period (blaze comps) that they will be rescheduled for the end of restrictions. If you have any questions let the student board know and we will inform you once we know about the new dates of the comps. Thanks!</p>
