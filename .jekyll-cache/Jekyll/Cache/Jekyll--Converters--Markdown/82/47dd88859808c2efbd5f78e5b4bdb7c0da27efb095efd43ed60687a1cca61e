I"Ï<p>For those who havenâ€™t seen yet, Jay Inslee recently made an announcement banning indoor gatherings starting tomorrow. Seattle times article: https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/inslee-to-ban-indoor-gatherings-and-dining-plus-issue-more-covid-19-restrictions-for-washington-state-industry-sources-say/. This means weâ€™re going to have to revert to how Exo was run during the last stay-at-home order. For teams who werenâ€™t in Exo back then, this means the Robot House is now closed for the foreseeable future. Teams are no longer allowed to work there under any circumstances. For teams who still want to work on their robots, we are allowing teams to take their robots and parts they need home.</p>
