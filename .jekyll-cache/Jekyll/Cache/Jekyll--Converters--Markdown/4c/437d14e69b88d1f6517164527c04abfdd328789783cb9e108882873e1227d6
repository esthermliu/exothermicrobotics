I"	<p>We are entering FVC Competitions, and the game this year is called “Hangin-A-Round”. This is the first year that FIRST is allowing anyone to sign up for the game because this year is a limited release pilot program. FIRST supplies each team a kit to build their robot from, and each team’s main objective is to build a robot that can score the most points by placing the softballs into the colored goals, by retaining control of the “atlas ball”, and by parking on the platform or by hanging on the bar.</p>
