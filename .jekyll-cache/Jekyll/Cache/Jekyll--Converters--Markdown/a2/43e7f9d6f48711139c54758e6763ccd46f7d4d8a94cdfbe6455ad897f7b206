I"b<p>As the new year rolls around, Team 10C is participating in two online challenges: the Robotics Team Website Challenge Sponsored by Dell and the Community Award Online Challenge Sponsored by Google. They decided to make the website as a way to showcase our club to our community, and also as Exothermic Robotics’ first ever website. Their community service video shows the team’s experiences with community volunteering and outreach to our local community. Voting opens soon so please vote to support 10C. You can read more about their entry to these challenges under the Challenges tab of About Us.</p>
