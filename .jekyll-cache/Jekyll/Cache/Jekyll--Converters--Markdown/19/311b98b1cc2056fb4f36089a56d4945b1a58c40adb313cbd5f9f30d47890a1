I"<p>For those who haven’t seen yet, Jay Inslee recently made an announcement banning indoor gatherings starting tomorrow. You can learn more through this <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/inslee-to-ban-indoor-gatherings-and-dining-plus-issue-more-covid-19-restrictions-for-washington-state-industry-sources-say/"><b>Seattle Times article</b></a>. This means we’re going to have to revert to how Exo was run during the last stay-at-home order. For teams who weren’t in Exo back then, this means the Robot House is now closed for the foreseeable future. Teams are no longer allowed to work there under any circumstances. For teams who still want to work on their robots, we are allowing teams to take their robots and parts they need home.</p>
