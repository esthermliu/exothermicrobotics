I"<p>At noon today, Exothermic Creation (10C) posted their new reveal video on YouTube titled “10C Vex Change Up Turkey Day Reveal”. The reveal showcases their robot and its functions from many angles. Our favorite highlights from the reveal are when the robot intake and outtake balls in a line that forms the shape of the number 10 and the shadow the robot casted on the wall at the beginning. We welcome everyone to check out the video (found here) and feel free to like, comment, and subscribe! Happy Thanksgiving everyone!</p>
