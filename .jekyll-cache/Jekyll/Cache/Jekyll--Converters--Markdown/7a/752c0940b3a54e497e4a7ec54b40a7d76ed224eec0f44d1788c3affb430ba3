I"w<p>Hi guys! We are Team 3632, also known as “The Combine.” Our team logo is the International Harvester Combine Harvester being driven by a Combine (from the game) soldier. Our official team name is Explorer Post 2036. We are led by Rick Tyler, Bruce Haley, and Rob Krasser, three of the greatest mentors in the world, and our team members consist of Chris H, Kris N, Tristan S, David T, and John T. Chris, Kris, and Tristan are all seniors, so this will be their first and unfortunately last year in robotics. 
We will be entering into FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) competitions, and we are super excited for the new season!</p>
