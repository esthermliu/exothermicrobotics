I"É<p>Our three teams competed at the Bellevue FIRST VEX Challenge Competition and did extremely well! Team 417 built a robot which they dubbed ‚ÄúCaptain Hook‚Äù. It was a powerful, heavy robot that could grab a movable goal with a claw, and then move around with it, putting rings on top of the spike. Team 417 consists of members Saul R, Eric H, Cravixtha A, Evangeline J, and Rebecca J. While Hook was an excellent robot and competitor, eventually making it into the semifinals with Team 575, they ultimately lost to an all-Canadian alliance. Congratulations to Team 417 for winning the Innovate Award for having the most creative robot!</p>
