Yesterday at the Bellingham ROBO-BASH VRC Tournament, 10E Exothermic Evolution set a new Washington State Robot Skills Record score of 172 points. As of today, they are ranked 5th in the world and have the second highest programming skills score (currently 60 points, 5 points behind first place). Additionally, 10E also won Tournament Champion with 917M winning 43-34. Good job to all the teams that competed, bringing back exciting news during finals season and we look forward to what the teams will be able to do at State!
