Exothermic Robotics recently competed in our first in-person tournament of the season! Freshmen teams and members learned how a tournament works, and all teams were able to learn something new from the experience. All teams received great results, with 10B ranking 6th in qualification rankings, 10C ranking 10th, 10X ranking 13th, 10E ranking 16th, 10F ranking 17th, 10D ranking 19th, and 10A ranking 22nd. 10B and 10C were also both tournament semifinalists, and in the end, 10B won the Excellence Award! Good job to all teams who competed, and see you at state!
