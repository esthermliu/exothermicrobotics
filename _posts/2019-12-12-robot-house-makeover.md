Hey everyone! Starting Saturday, we are going to be making some pretty big changes to the robot house so we are going to have a full cleaning weekend to make space for the new field risers. This means that everyone will have to pack up their tables into their tool box so we can shuffle around tables. The field will be out of commission starting Saturday morning and until probably Monday or Tuesday night and no one will have a table for most of Saturday and Sunday. We need as many people to come as possible to help with this massive move so every team is expected to come help. We will figure out new table assignments after everything is setup so probably on Monday night or Tuesday.
