This is our first robot ever! We've affectionately dubbed it "Otis". It has a tank tread lifter that sucks softballs off the field and then places it onto a tray on top of it. The tray lifts up to place the softballs into the highest goal. Additionally, we are also making another robot just for fun, which we have jokingly named, "The Goat". The Goat can't take in many softballs, but it can hang from the bar and score a couple of points. It mainly specializes in defense, ramming other robots around it, preventing them from scoring. Soon, we will be competing Otis in the Bellevue FIRST VEX Challenge Competition and we are really stoked!

Here is a quick video of Otis:
