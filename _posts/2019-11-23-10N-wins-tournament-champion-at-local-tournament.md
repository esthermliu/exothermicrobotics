Earlier today, Team 10N (Exothermic Ion) competed at the Entropy Thanksgiving VRC Tournament. They won 21-13 in the finals to receive the tournament champions award while paired with team 44777U. Although they have already qualified for state at the Turkey Trot Tournament last week, this is their first time winning a trophy this season, qualifying them for the CREATE U.S. Open. Have a restful Thanksgiving Break everyone!
