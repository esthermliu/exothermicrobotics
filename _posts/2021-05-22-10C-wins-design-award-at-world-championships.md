VRC Vex Remote World Championships 2021 officially ended today. All Exo teams that competed did an exceptional job. Special shoutout to team 10E for being alliance captains and moving on to subdivision eliminations (all as a freshman team!), and 10C for moving on to subdivision semifinals! In addition, great job to 10B for ranking 20th in the Mercury (top) division of LRS with 126 points driving and 103 points programming!
