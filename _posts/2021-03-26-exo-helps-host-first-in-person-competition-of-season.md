Exothermic Robotics members and alumni are helping host WA's first in-person tournament of the Change Up season! Earlier today, members headed to Calvary Chapel Eastside, where the competition is being held, to set up fields and equipment and ensure Covid protocols are followed. Thank you everyone for your help, and we can't wait to see everyone compete tomorrow!
