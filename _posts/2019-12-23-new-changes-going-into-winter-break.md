As Winter Break rolls in, all the EXO teams are starting to use their break time to improve their robot for the more intense second half of the season. Depending on their goals for State and possibly Worlds, teams are improving, or even completely rebuilding their robot. Teams are also getting used to the new field risers. The difference in the height of the field causes the perspective of the drivers to change, therefore teams have to adapt to the new height. The first competition after Winter Break will be the third day of the King of the Tower League on 1/8, which teams 10C, 10D, and 10X will be attending.
