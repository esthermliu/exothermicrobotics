Quad Quandary is a game that consists of small rings and movable goal posts. The size of the robot cannot exceed 18"x18"x18", and the teams cannot introduce new robots in the middle of the match. Additionally, identical robots are not allowed on the field. Before entering into the competition, robots must past inspection and can only contain VEX parts (some VEX parts are considered illegal however).

Quad Quandary is played on as 12' by 12' square with two alliances: a red alliance and a blue alliance. The main objective is to obtain a higher score than the other alliance by picking up rings and placing them in goals. Overall, there are 50 rings, 25 for the red and 25 for the blue alliance. On the field, there are 44 rings, and each team is given 3 rings as a preload before the match starts.
