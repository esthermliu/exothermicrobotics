This year, we will be participating in VRC along with FVC. The VRC Game this year is called Bridge Battle. Bridge Battle is played on a 12'x12' square field. There are two alliances: one red alliance, and one blue alliance composed of two teams each. At the beginning of each match is a 20 second autonomous peirod, which is followed by a 2 minute driver-controlled section. The main object of the game is to obtain a higher score than the other alliance by placing tennis balls and bonus balls into goals. Also, alliances can get extra points by parking their robot onto one of the two platforms. The team that does better in Autonomous gets a bonus score added afterward.
