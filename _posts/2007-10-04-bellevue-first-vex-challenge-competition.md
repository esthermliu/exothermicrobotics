Our three teams competed at the Bellevue FIRST VEX Challenge Competition and did extremely well! Team 417 built a robot which they dubbed "Captain Hook". It was a powerful, heavy robot that could grab a movable goal with a claw, and then move around with it, putting rings on top of the spike. Team 417 consists of members Saul R, Eric H, Cravixtha A, Evangeline J, and Rebecca J. While Hook was an excellent robot and competitor, eventually making it into the semifinals with Team 575, they ultimately lost to an all-Canadian alliance. Congratulations to Team 417 for winning the Innovate Award for having the most creative robot!

Team 418 built a robot which they dubbed "Chopstix". Chopstix was also a fierce robot and was the fastest robot of the club. Team 418 consists of Cody M, Richard P, Joel C, Rishi G, and Kris K. Congratulations to Team 418 for winning the Regional Finalist Award and the Inspire Award at the Bellevue FVC event!

Team 575 built their robot for this competition just a week before the competition because they gave up their Plan A robot. Nonetheless, they teamed up with Team 417 and made it into the semifinals. This team consists of David T, Preetum N, Paul C, Micah Z, Ranjan P, and Alex.

Congrats to all the Exothermic Robotics teams that participated at the Bellevue competition! Go EXO!
