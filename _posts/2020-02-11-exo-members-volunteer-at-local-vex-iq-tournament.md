On Sunday, February 9, members from teams 10C, 10D, and 10X volunteered at the LWSD Vex IQ Tournament at Timberline Middle School. They took on various jobs such as being judges or refereeing and sometimes commentating the matches. All the volunteers enjoyed volunteering spending their day to help out at a local tournament. After the event Exothermic Robotics received an invitation from the school asking us to showcase our robots at their end of the year celebration, and to introduce middle schoolers to Vex EDR.
