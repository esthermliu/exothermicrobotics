Last Saturday (12/14) teams 10A, 10B, and 10E competed at the Warrior Bash VRC Tournament in Mattawa, WA. This was an exciting competition for the teams since it was the first tournament this season where Exo teams saw wall bots. This will be Exoâ€™s last tournament of 2019 and we are looking forward to the improvement when the season resumes in 2020!
