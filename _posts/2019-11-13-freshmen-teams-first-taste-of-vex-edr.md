title: Freshmen Teamsâ€™ First Taste of VEX EDR
showThumbnail: false
---

Today, three of our freshmen teams (10C, 10D, and 10X) will be competing in their first Vex EDR competition: The King of the Tower League. This league is meant for new and middle school teams, so our new teams can practice with others that have the same experience as them. This will be a good learning experience for everyone because teams will get to experience using the Competition Control and a 2v2 format for the first time. This will put them slightly ahead of the other freshmen teams since they will be less stressed over how the competition will work when competing against experienced teams. Good luck to everyone competing at the league!
