Yesterday, teams 10B and 10C competed in Exo’s first competition of the season! <a href = "https://www.robotevents.com/robot-competitions/vex-robotics-competition/RE-VRC-20-2488.html#general-info"> <b>VRC on the [Virtual] Plains</b></a> was a Remote, Live, Skills-Only tournament, meaning the 8 teams signed up ran their skills runs at their own workplaces during designated timeslots. In the end, 10B won Design Award, and 10C won Robot Skills 2nd Place! Congrats to them and good job to all the teams at the comp! Next step will be the In-Person and Remote Robot Skills-Only Event in Bellevue. We’re so excited to see all the amazing robot designs there!
